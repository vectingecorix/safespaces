\title{Safe Spaces: An Introductory Course}

\maketitle 

\begin{abstract}
Safe spaces are key icons of modern political debates. However, from a mathematical point of view the subject lacks rigorous studies. In this paper, we aim for a better understanding of safe spaces by providing exact definitions of safety inspired by linear algebra and analysis. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}



\section{Preliminaries}

\begin{definition}[emancipated, safe spaces, unsafe spaces]
	Let $K$ be a field and $V$ be a $K$-vector space. We call $v \in V$ \emph{emancipated} if for every endomorphism $\alpha: V \to V$ and every $w \in V$ it holds that $\alpha(v) = \alpha(w)$. Further, we call $V$ a \emph{$K$-safe space} (or \emph{safe space} for short) if $V$ contains only emancipated vectors. Otherwise, $V$ is an \emph{unsafe space}.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[integrable]
	Let $K$ be a field, $V$ be a $K$-safe space, and $W$ be a unsafe space.
	A vector $w \in W$ is called \emph{integrable} if $V \cup \{w\}$ is a $K$-safe space.
\end{definition}

\section{Results}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:safe-space-trivial}
	Let $V$ be a $K$-safe space. Then $V$ is trivial.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Assume that $V$ is not trivial, i.e. there exists some $v \neq 0$ in $V$. Then for $\alpha := \text{id}$ we get $\alpha(v) = v \neq 0 = \alpha(0)$. Hence, $V$ is an unsafe space.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:safe-space-dim0}
	Let $K$ be a field and $V$ be a vector space. Then $V$ is a safe space if and only if $\dim V = 0$.
\end{corollary}
The proof is left as an exercise to interested readers as it follows directly from Theorem~\ref{thm:safe-space-trivial}.

\begin{corollary}
	Let $K$ be a field and $V, W$ $K$-safe spaces. Then $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $K$ be a field, $V$ be some finite-dimensional $K$-vector space and $\varphi : V \to V$ a $K$-linear function. Then the following statements are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item $\varphi$ is bijective.
		\item $\varphi$ is injective.
		\item $\varphi$ is surjective.
		\item $\ker(\varphi)$ is a safe space.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The proof is left as an exercise to the reader.

\begin{theorem}
	Let $V$ be a safe space. Then $V$ is closed under integration.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $W$ be an unsafe space. For every $w \in W$ the following implication holds: If $w$ is integrable then $w = 0 \in V$. Therefore, $V$ is closed under integration.
\end{proof}
